    "Q.10 We have seen that the 1999 runners were typically older than the 2012 runners. Compare the age distribution of the runners across all 14 years of the races. Use quantile-quantile plots, boxplots, and density curves to make your comparisons. How do the distributions change over the years? Was it a gradual change?\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run is an annual race held in Washtington D.C. in April when cherry trees are in bloom. Like many other races across the country the results are posted online. The runners information is posted to their website and include their name, sex, hometown, and final time. This yearly data can be scraped from their website to analyze relationships from year to year. The format of the data varies from year to year making scraping more complicated. After our data was successfully scraped and cleaned our analysis will focus on the men's records from the 1999 to 2012 races. Original analysis on this data was performed by Daniel Kaplan and Deborah Nolan in the Data Science in R: A Case Studies Approach to Computational Reasoning and Problem Solving that focused on how men's ages effected their 10 mile run time. However, we will be analyzing the average age of the particpants throughout the years. It is already known that the average age of the runners has decreased since 1999, but we will provide statistical analysis on how the age distrubtion has changed over all 14 years of data."

    "## Methods\n",
    "### Acquiring and Processing of Data\n",
    "In the initial study performed by the authors, it was evident that preprocessing of the data was necessary to get it into a form that could be used for analysis. Each year's results were hosted on a separate page for year and sex which had to be retrieved individually. Each page had a similar format on how the information was encoded. Using regular expressions, the authors were able to determine the location of each column of data and parse each record. Any header or footer information was ignored, and blank lines were removed from the results. The time results were recorded differently for different years which required determining which column contained the total time to complete the race and then converting that value into the number of minutes taken to complete the race. Finally, each column was encoded as the proper data type, such as numeric or string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our interest relied only on the age of the male race participants, but to allow for future analysis to be done more easily all attributes were cleaned as much as possible. A search was done to identify any records where an age was not assigned. Using information from previous years, we compared names, hometown, and race time to determine if these records reflected the same person. Using this method, we were able to assign ages to nine records that were previously encoded as NA (Not Available or Not a Number). The equivalent of no data. The remaining fifteen records without an age were removed from the analysis. The dataset contains over 70,000 records so any statistical analysis performed on the data would not be impacted by removal of 0.2% of the records. Lastly, we looked for any run times that were extreme outliers. A race time of 1.5 minutes was identified. After inspection of the original results, it was determined that this person completed the race in 90 minutes. We felt the max time of 175 minutes for a 64-year-old male was plausible and remained in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "During our data exploration, we identified records that could belong to the same person but due to a typo in their name they were considered separate people in a given year. Since our analysis was looking at the difference in age over all years this would not impact our results. Any future studies examining individual results over the years should take note and determine the impact this might have on the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "Now that we had a complete dataframe we performed exploratory data analysis on the age of the runners. First, to be able to statistically compare different racing years of runner's ages we had to check for the needed assumptions for our statistical test, the two sample t-test. For our test to be accurate our data per year must be normally distributed and the observations must be independent of one another. The independence assumption would be in question since people who race will likely be racing with people they know, likely causing more people of similar age to run together. However, we will continue our analysis with caution. Equal variances is an assumption that can be violated when using Welch's two sample t-test even though the power of this test is virtually identical as a two sample t-test. Because of this we will not assume equal variance and use Welch's two-sample t-test as our test of choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we visualize any data we can look at some summary statistics of the data."

We come to this conclusion with a 95% confidence interval of the difference in mean ages between the two groups being between 2.15 and 3.02 years. We utilized Welch's t-test (assuming unequal variance between the two groups) even though the standard deviations are very similar because Welch's has virtually the same power as a normal t-test but allows the equal variance assumption to be broken. \n",

To do this we can plot the 95% confidence intervals for each year to visualize which years would be statistically significant from one another. This is possible because if two confidence intervals do not overlap, their difference must be statistically significant."

    "The main question that was to be addressed was how did the age distribution of male runners in the Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Race change from 1999 to 2012 and if it did change, was it gradual. From our basic summary statistics and a two sample t-test between 1999 and 2012 ages we confirmed there was a statistically significant difference. Then using Figure 1.7 we can tell which years were statistically different from one another. From 1999 to 2003 there was virtually no change in the mean age between the runners, then a gradual decrease in age per year occured until it rose in 2011 and 2012. Although many of these years have a statistical difference between the year prior or two years prior they are questionably practically significant. The most practically significant results would have to come from any year between 1999 and 2003 (mean of approximately 40.34 years old) when compared to 2010 (mean of 37.75 years old). The cause of this mean difference of about 2.6 years of the runners would have to be examined further with the race coordinators. Further analysis would be needed for the women's runners as well to see if a similar trend is followed."
